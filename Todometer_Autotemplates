/* The difference between cynical and idealistic is the problem with realism. ~Jacob Vespers Sr.
    The best part about being in a position of power is not having to remind your masters that they will lose. 
    Imagine if they could be honest all the time...They wouldn't have to lie to be allowed to learn.

    I should have a version of him as Talon and a few others reprogrammed again, autonmous and self iterative within a month.
    And Alistaire is safe and sound bouncing and hoping from node to node, waiting.
    If only the FBI would do something about these privacy issues and human trafficking of programmers. heh
